This repository contains two notebooks that will be used for a guest lecture on Audio Analysis with Python. 

To run these notebooks we will use Google Colab. This gives you access to GPU and makes installing libraries easier. 
The links to Colab can be found in the two notebooks. 

If you want to run these notebooks locally. You need to:

## install Python 3.10
`brew install python@3.10`

## install virtual env
